#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Since the loop will execute itself n times. The time complexity is O(n)


b) The inner loop will run log(i+1), where i is n-1 at most. And the outer loop runs n times. The time complexity is O(nlog(n))


c) Assuming n is a positive integer, the function will be called once by the user. The time complexity is O(n).

## Exercise II
1. Drop an egg from the ground floor and continue to drop an egg as you move up one floor until the floor from which you drop the egg breaks is present. This is a linear search problem. Worst case (average case) being O(n) and the best case being O(1). You can expect best case performace since the outer shell of the egg does not become more durable as you move up floors of the building and drop the egg from a higher floor.
